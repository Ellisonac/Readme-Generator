# Turbo Encabulation

## Description

For a number of years now, work has been proceeding in order to bring perfection to the crudely conceived idea of a transmission that would not only supply inverse reactive current for use in unilateral phase detractors, but would also be capable of automatically synchronizing cardinal grammeters. Such an instrument is the turbo encabulator.

## Installation

The turbo-encabulator has now reached a high level of development, and itâ€™s being successfully used in the operation of novertrunnions


## How to Use

To prime the turbo encabulator, run the following:


```javascript

  let flux = 'Capacitive Diractance';
  let status = encabulate(flux,'fumble')
  console.log(status) #expect 'primed'

```



Then, to instantiate a magneto bearing run the following:


```javascript

  let options = {
    meter: 'reciprocal',
    flux
  }
  let bearing = new Magneto(options);

```


## How to Contribute

This code can be improved by any third level certified Trunnion Transform Operator


## How to Test

Whenever a forescent skor motion is required, it may also be employed in conjunction with a drawn reciprocation dingle arm, to reduce sinusoidal repleneration
